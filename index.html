<!-- Note:

#Goal: characteristics and behavior of the position property: static and relative.

    1. Every element created comes with a 'position: static' by default, that is, we cannot move the element.
    2. Assigning a position: The 'position: relative' takes into account the relative position of where the element was created and moves to
    the indicated location.
    3. The 'position: relative' allows us to use 4th properties being them; top, bottom, left, right. Attention: The element will move
    taking into account the place where it was created, that is, the place it is occupying.
    4. Regarding the 'z-index' property, it allows us to change the z axis, which by default has a value of 0, which would be the browser context.
    If we change the value from 0 to 1 it means that we are creating a new context for this element put in front of the browser context, that is, in the screen.
